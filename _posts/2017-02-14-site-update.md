First of all, thanks to everyone who turned out last night, Monday,
February 13th, 2017, and
to [Prime Digital Academy](https://www.primeacademy.io/) for letting
us use their awesome space.

I was inspired to update this site by adding a new
section, [Learning Resources]({{site.baseurl}}/learning) listing
online resources for learning Ruby and Rails.

Check it out, I hope you like it. If you have feedback, please use
the [issues](https://github.com/railsmn/railsmn.github.io/issues)
section of the site's github repo.

Again, my heartfelt thanks!
