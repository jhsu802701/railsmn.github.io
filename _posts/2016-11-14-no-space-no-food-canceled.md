title: "No space - No food - Meetups Cancelled"

---

My friends, we are in dire straights as a group.

Our space sponsor, SportsEngine, after having been acquired by NBC Sports, has been
given restrictions on security, which means our meetup space and time is no longer
available to us.

Along with the lack of food sponsorship, and the uncertaintly surrounding this,
I've cancelled future monthly meetups for the time being.

I'm also reaching out for someone to step up for organizing this meetup. 
I no longer have time to spend finding sponsors, getting things organized,
and keeping things running. I need help for this meetup group to keep going.

Contact me through meetup.com "Message the Organizers" link (it will go to all
the people marked as organizers, not just me) if you can provide help.

p.s. - I still want to be involved, I love teaching, I love your questions,
and want to help people learn Rails.
