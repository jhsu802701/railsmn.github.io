title: "No space - No food - Meetups Cancelled"

---

My friends, we are in dire straights as a group.

Our space sponsor, SportsEngine, after having been acquired by NBC Sports, has been
given restrictions on security, which means our meetup space and time is no longer
available to us.

Along with the lack of food sponsorship, and the uncertaintly surrounding this,
I've cancelled future monthly meetups for the time being.

I'm also reaching out for someone to step up for organizing this meetup.
I no longer have time to spend finding sponsors, getting things organized,
and keeping things running. I need help for this meetup group to keep going.

If you are interested in discussing ideas about getting new space and
food sponsors, the place to do that is our Google Group
at
