Another site update, this time cleaning up the installation
instructions.

There have been numerous attempts to explain how to get up and running
with a clean Ruby on Rails development environment in order to learn
and practice the things we go over in the meetup, on hack nights, and
when following tutorials.

I went through what was there and tried to clear things out.

The new emphasis is on using the Cloud9 development environment in the
cloud, which really makes learning simple. There is still some
instruction on using a virtual machine for the brave.

Send me an [email](mailto:{{page.author.email}}) if you have any
comments, or create
an [issue](https://github.com/railsmn/railsmn.github.io/issues) (or
even better, make a PR with your changes!)
