We have a new monthly venue!

After we lost our sponsorship for meetings at [CoCoMSP], I sent out a
call for help finding a new location. [Odell Tuttle], VPEng at
[Sport Ngin] offered to host us.

This month's meetup was held at Sport Ngin, and it is a pretty nice
space for us. Odell has offered the space to Rails.MN on an ongoing
basis for our monthly meetups.

Thanks, Odell, and Sport Ngin!
