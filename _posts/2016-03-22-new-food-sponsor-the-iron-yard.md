A great big thank you and welcome to [The Iron Yard], a new
development boot-camp coming into the Twin Cities. They are sponsoring
our monthly meetup's pizza and soda, which is really awesome. Thanks

As some of you may know, The Iron Yard is one of the world’s largest
and fastest-growing code schools, and they recently announced the
opening of a new campus in Minneapolis.

As a sponsor, The Iron Yard will be offering our members a special
$500 discount on tuition for their 12-week Front End Engineering
course starting on March 28. Additionally, The Iron Yard offers a
diversity scholarship to make technology education more open and
accessible to all underrepresented groups including, but not limited
to: women, people of color, military personnel and people with
disabilities. Each recipient is awarded a $1,000 tuition discount
scholarship and there is no cap on the number of students per class
who can receive support!  The diversity scholarship can be combined
with the RailsMN discount, for a total of $1,500 tuition scholarship.

With nearly 400 job openings for entry-level software engineers coming
online every 90 days in Minneapolis, if you are serious about changing
or starting a career as a developer, this might be a great opportunity
for you!
