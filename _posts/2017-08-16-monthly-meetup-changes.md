Big changes coming for the meetup group! Read on for a list of things we're changing.

## NOTE: NEW TIME: 5:30pm

We are beginning the meetups from now on at 5:30pm (instead of 6:30pm)
to make gaining entry to the building where Prime is located easier.

## LOCATION: Prime Digital Academy

**We are back at Prime Digital Academy in their new downtown
Minneapolis location**

301 4th Ave. S - 5th Floor, Minneapolis, MN

(This is the North building, between 3rd and 4th Streets along 4th Ave.)

## COST

We are going to start charging $5.00 for the meetup, in order to
defray some of the cost for providing drinks and snacks.

## PARTICIPANTS

The meetups will be limited in size to 20 people including guests.

## MEETUP AGENDA

We're adopting a new agenda and format for the meetup. Instead of a
talk and hack session, we'll be doing the following:

5:30pm - 6:00pm: Arrive, mingle, eat something, network

6:00pm - 7:00pm: Ruby and Rails Lesson - code along practical instruction

7:00pm - 8:00pm: Project work

## CURRICULUM

I'll be pulling together a curriculum of lessons, exercises, small
projects, and tutorials that will extend over the year, to give a
sense of what we'll be focusing on each month.

## GROUP PROJECTS

Instead of a hack night format, we're going to be reinstituting group
projects for people to work on together, to apply the skills you're
learning right away. I'd like to set up a couple of different projects
for people to work on, depending on the attendance. I want to limit
group size to 5 people. My intent is that you'll form up into a team
that works together month to month at the meetup.
