We are back for the month of August, 2017,
with {% include external_link.html link=site.data.links.primedigital %} at the **new** campus in
downtown Minneapolis, in the Grain Exchange building.

Some of you may recall that we were hosted at CoCo Downtown in the
Grain Exchange several years ago.

We are going to need a couple volunteers to do door duty as the doors
close at 6:00pm, and we don't start until 6:30pm. Two people would
make it so you can switch off.

I hope to see some familiar faces this month. I am seeking input for
how to best run the program, since there doesn't seem to be much
returning interest.
