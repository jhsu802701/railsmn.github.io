Rails.MN is sponsoring a [new **weekly** meetup][new_meetup] for those wishing to spend time together digging deeper into Rails.

There is no format, this is an informal study / hack group of people who want to get time to work on learning Rails together.

It's typically at the Spyglass in Northeast Minneapolis (a couple blocks from Sport Ngin).

Led by Ben, you can sign up on [meetup.com][new_meetup].

Bring your laptops, bring your projects! Have fun together!
