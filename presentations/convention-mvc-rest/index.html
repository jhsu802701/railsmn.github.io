                    ## Convention Over Configuration
 
                    Ruby on Rails is an opinionated framework that makes assumptions about how you do things

                    ## Convention Over Configuration

                    ## How? 

                    - Create rules about things
                        - How classes should be named
                        - How your resources should be related to your database 
                        - What URLs should be in your application
                    - Be opinionated about technology choices
                        - REST
                        - MVC 
                        - Asset Pipeline
                        - ERB
                    </script>

                    ## Convention Over Configuration

                    ### Caveat

                    Sometimes you do not always want to follow convention and would rather make your own decisions. Configuration is still possible within Rails but be sure that it is justified or you will spend a lot of time fighting the framework

                    ## Model, View, Controller

                    MVC is a software design 'pattern' that is commonly used in web development to guide how you should structure where different pieces of code should be kept based on what it does

                    ## Model, View, Controller

                    ### Benefits

                    - Keeps your code clean 
                    - Clear distinction (abstraction) between the design, business logic and data of your application
                    - Makes it easier to add and test new features

                    ## Model, View, Controller

                    ### Models

                    Models give a logical representation of the 'things' in your application, like users or posts or items. Model objects can define what information is associated to a user, for example, a name or e-mail address. Models may also define relationships with other objects (a user may have many posts).

                    ## Model, View, Controller

                    ### Views

                    A view is generally a visual representation of your model(s). They can show specific attributes of a model and give your application users an interface for creating new objects. Views may be HTML code or newer implementations may include JSON, a 'serialized' representation of your model.

                    ## Model, View, Controller

                    ### Controllers

                    A controller is the 'glue' between your models and your views. Your view needs to have access to the data from your model, and a controller is how it gets it. Controllers may also define some business logic, such as validating form input or limiting what a user can or can not see when they load the page.

                    ## REST

                    REST stands for 'REpresentational State Transfer' and is a modern way to access the resources of your application via HTTP, the communication standard of the web. It utilizes some formerly uncommon HTTP 'verbs' (GET, PUT, DELETE, POST) to manipulate things like users or posts in your application.

                    ### Benefits

                    - Allows convention over configuration for routing to controllers 
                    - Creates URL consistency for URLs

                    ## Rails and Databases

                    ### What is a database?

                    A database is a place where you can store data (usernames, passwords, blog posts, web store items) in a way that is easy to insert, search and delete from. Most modern databases have strict rules about how data is stored in a way that is secure and reliable. Information in the database can be modified by using another programming language called SQL (structured query language). There are many types of databases each with their own additions to SQL, but most of them use the same core SQL queries

                    <script type="text/template">
                    ## Rails and Databases

                    ### Types of Databases

                    - Relational, most common and dependable for modeling data like users and the things they own
                        - PostgreSQL (typical Rails DB of choice)
                        - MySQL
                    - Non-relational (NoSQL or 'Not Only SQL') are gaining popularity and can be good options for data with a less 'rigid' structure, like geolocation data
                        - MongoDB
                        - Redis

                    ---- 

                    ### Both are compatible with Rails and great choices for different purposes

                    ## Rails and Databases

                    ### ActiveRecord

                    ActiveRecord is one of the best ORM (object-relationship mapper) libraries out there. An ORM allows you to access database table as you would a standard Ruby on Rails object in lieu of using traditional SQL

                    ## Rails and Databases

                    ### Benefits of ActiveRecord

                    - Almost never have to write raw SQL 
                    - Easier to read and maintain
                    - Bakes in a lot of security and performance best practices
                    - Database agnostic (can change from MySQL to PostgreSQL easily)
                    - Incorporates many database conventions
                    - One of the best ORM implementations across any web framework

                    page.parts.where(title: 'why')
                    
                    ```

                    Raw SQL
                    ```
                    SELECT "refinery_pages".* FROM "refinery_pages" 
                    WHERE "refinery_pages"."id" = $1 LIMIT 1  [["id", 1]]

                    SELECT "refinery_page_parts".* FROM "refinery_page_parts" WHERE 
                    "refinery_page_parts"."refinery_page_id" = 1 AND 
                    "refinery_page_parts"."title" = 'why'
                    ```
