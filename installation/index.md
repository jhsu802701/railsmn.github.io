# Preparing for Rails

Since there is group hack-session during these events, we strongly recommend that everyone bring a laptop with Ruby on Rails installed! If for any reason you run into issues with that tutorial and can't get things running, that's okay too. Just bring your laptop to the event and we can help you get set up.

## Choose Your Own Installation Adventure

There are a variety of ways to install Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

### Recommendation: [Virtual Machine + Vagrant](vagrant.html)

Our recommended setup process involves installing a virtual machine, so that Ruby and Rails run inside a managed environment. This limits installation headaches and puts everyone in the class on similar footing, regardless of whether their laptop is running Windows, Ubuntu or OS X. [Follow these instructions](vagrant.html) to get started.

### Alternative: [Railsbridge Installfest](http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/)

Some people find setting up Vagrant and VirtualBox to be an unnecessary headache, or just want the experience of running Rails on their own machine. For whatever reason, if you want to skip the virtual machine and install Ruby and Rails on your own laptop, [the Railsbridge Installfest](http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/) will guide you through the process.

### Worst-case scenario: [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/)

If the above options don't pan out -- maybe you brought an older or lighter-duty laptop and want to save time & hassle -- you're not out of luck. [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/) is a hosted development environment. That means it'll only work if you're connected to the internet (and wi-fi can be flaky!) but you can get started right away, without installing anything on your laptop. Create an account at [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/) to get started.
