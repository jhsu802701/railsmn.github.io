**BRING**

A Laptop: *Please* come with your laptop prepared with a working Rails development environment installed. You should test this by building a really simple Rails application, basically a "Hello World" sort of thing.

Last few months, most attendees have gotten up an running quickly on Cloud9 (https://c9.io), a software development environment in the cloud.
