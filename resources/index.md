title: Learning Resources

There are many, many resources for learning Ruby and Rails. Here are a
few to get you started.

## Ruby

Learning Ruby itself is important to understand how to work with Ruby
on Rails. It isn't essential that you have a deep understanding of
Ruby before jumping into Rails, but having some background will
definitely help.

The following are essential references online for Ruby. Bookmark
these, keep them pinned in your browser, etc.

* [Ruby-Lang](http://www.ruby-lang.org) is the home for Ruby, with
  jumping off points for installing ruby, learning how to write ruby
  scripts, and keeping up to date with the ruby community. Most
  especially, hit up
  the
  [documentation section](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/)
  of that site for a list of great learning resources for Ruby.

* [Ruby Core Reference](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core) is the
  documentation for the core libraries that make up the basics of
  Ruby's classes and modules.

* [Ruby Standard Library](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib) is the place
  to find documentation for the standard library that is always
  shipped with the ruby installation (things like working with URLs,
  making HTTP requests, JSON, YAML, and XML data, etc).

* [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) is where the thousands of
  libraries, applications, and other reusable stuff has been
  published.

Online sites for learning Ruby include:

* [RubyMonk](https://rubymonk.com/) provides interactive Ruby
  tutorials and exercises to learn Ruby's ways and idioms.

* [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/) is a
  more fundamentalist approach to learning how to program in
  Ruby. This site is a good place to start if you don't have any
  programming experience.

* Chris Pine's [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) is
  a well-respected book for absolute beginners in learning how to
  program. Chris uses Ruby to teach programming concepts.

* Avdi Grim's [RubyTapas](https://www.rubytapas.com/) is a video
  subscription site that provides a "small plate" of ruby several
  times a week.

If books are your thing, there are two for Ruby that come highly
recommended:

* [Programming Ruby](https://pragprog.com/book/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0)
  Known as the "Pickaxe" book (because of the cover), this is the
  definitive reference for writing Ruby scripts. This latest edition
  covers versions 1.9 and 2.0, which is a little out of date, yet is
  still an excellent resource.

* [The Well-Grounded Rubyist](https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-rubyist-second-edition)
  by David Black, also referred to as "The Black Book", is the
  definitive book for learning Ruby. The second edition covers up to
  version 2.1, so is also a little out of date, but it is still an
  excellent resource.

## Rails

The essential online references for Rails include:

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is the main site for Rails,
  and has jumping off points for getting into writing Rails
  applications.

* The [Ruby on Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) are a
  collection of tutorials for learning various aspects of the Rails
  system. The
  [Getting Started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
  guide is the best place to jump in.

* The [Ruby on Rails API](http://api.rubyonrails.org/) contains the
  documentation for all the gems that make up the Rails framework.

For learning Rails online, there are a few sites:

* Michael Hartl's [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)
  is the definitive, most up-to-date online course for learning
  Rails. Highly recommended.

* [RailsBridge](http://docs.railsbridge.org/docs/) is another
  excellent set of starting out tutorials.

* [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/) is an older site with video
  learning segments; it hasn't been updated in quite some time. The
  subscription is only $9 in perpetuity (or if the author decides to
  start republishing). While it's old, many of the concepts provided
  in the videos are still applicable, and it's a good learning
  resource.

Recommended Books for learning Rails include:

* [Agile Web Development with Rails 5](https://pragprog.com/book/rails5/agile-web-development-with-rails-5),
  aka "DHH's Book", is the latest in the series of books that came out
  of the development of Rails.

* [Rails 4 in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action)
  is one of the best books around on learning Rails. Although it is
  for version 4, almost everything still applies in this book to
  learning version 5. You'll find two of the authors in the
  Freenode.net `#rubyonrails` IRC channel, Ryan Bigg ("Radar") and
  Rebecca Skinner ("sevenseacat"), whom are very helpful.

## Podcasts

Sometimes listening to folks talk about their experiences and what
they've learned is helpful.

* [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues) is a weekly panel
  discussion

* [Greater than Code](https://www.greaterthancode.com/) is a newer
  weekly panel discussion
